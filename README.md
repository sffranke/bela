## Until here Bela is controlable via Remote Control 

In addition there are more possibilities to control Bela:

 -- Incredible Rhasspy and Node-RED for speech control
    https://github.com/synesthesiam/rhasspy

    Raspberry Pi 4

    3,3 V to 5 V Shifter

    ReSpeaker Mic Array v2.0

    Small USB Speaker

  -- Using the also the great Web GUI of Leukipp https://github.com/leukipp/OpenCatWeb to control the robot
  
  -- Using the HC-06 Bluetooth RF Transceiver Serial Module to control the robot via Smart Phone (voice and keyboard)
  
  -- In Progress:
  
     Robot shall recognize different faces and react (greet, bark, bite :) ).
     
     Using OpenCV
     
     USB-CAM

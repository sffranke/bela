Testing command-line inputs

    ./ardserial.py c->works

    ./ardserial.py c15-> gives c1   5..which might be a problem

    ./ardserial.py m1 75, m 1 75 also work

    ./ardserial.py u-> works

    ./ardSerial.py i 1 9 9 13 13 1-> works


    ./ardserial.py u 0 7->works

Testing wrapper() with schedule

    The cases with ints arrays work

    Single letter cases seem to work (although things 'ktr' and 'c8' might have issues)

    string arrays might be an issues

    Even though the last process is a d, the light doesnt turn off.

    Beep works

There might be a bug in 'k'
